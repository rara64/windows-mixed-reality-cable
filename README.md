# DIY cable replacement for Windows Mixed Reality headsets [WIP]
This project focuses on allowing the replacement of the proprietary VR cable in Mixed Reality headsets.

> [!NOTE]
> I'm currently working on [replacing it with a single USB-C plug](https://github.com/rara64/windows-mixed-reality-usb-c), but here, you'll soon find a version that doesn't require a USB-C DP-capable port on your computer and allows for a direct replacement with a USB and HDMI cable.

If you're here you probably know that the proprietary cables used in these headsets are prone to failure and unavailable for purchase as a separate part.
Due to damaged cables, dozens of Mixed Reality headsets end up in the trash. I want to change that.

# Roadmap
- Create a plug extender board that will extend the 30-pin connector inside the headset outside the device
- Create a matching PCB with USB+HDMI ports that will mount inside a 3D printed case on the headset's band
